# tomcat docker setup as application server

sample.war was copied from
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/sample/

samplewebapp.war
https://www.middlewareinventory.com/blog/sample-web-application-war-file-download/

Both needed tomcat 7.0 to run. To access applications use the following URLS:

http:/localhost:8889/sample

http://localhost:8889/SampleWebApp


All of this is deployed using command:

docker-compose up --build
